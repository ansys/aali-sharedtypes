      This group includes core structs for describing and managing workflows:

      - `WorkflowDefinition`
      - `NodeDefinition`
      - `NodeType`
      - `ExecutionContext`
      - `ExecutionStep`

      These types are used to define the structure of workflows and manage execution state across services.
